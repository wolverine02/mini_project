A basic Snake Game 


So I've created a snake and an object for our snake so that whenever the object comes in contact with
our snake's mouth the object gets eaten in a way which then is added to the snake's body. By each passing
object eaten by the snake, our snake becomes longer and longer in length. And alas when the snake touches its own body 
the game is over and the score is displayed for how much time you've successfully managed to eat the random pop up object created in the game.
